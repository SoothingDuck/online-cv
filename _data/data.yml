    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Longtime nerd in computer science and applied mathematics, I
      spend the last years 10 years of my career tackling problems
      with data in SQL, R and Python in major french companies in a
      result oriented fashion (driven by performance and functional
      quality).  I am currently on sabbatical leave, and at a
      crossroad of my career in which I want to switch to functional
      programming and more particularly Clojure as I realized it is
      what I like to do best in my current role.  I would be happy if
      you gave me a chance to prove my competence in this field
      so that I can work with you on real-life projects in Clojure.
