          New role at Enedis in the datawarehouse architecture team dealing with production workloads after being promoted to Solution Architect at Teradata. Notable achievements :
          - Maded a proof of concept of a tool in Clojure (with <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/clj-antlr">clj-antlr</a>) to detect problems in SQL join performance before they go to production : <b>prevented at least 2 unrequired product joins in production</b>
          - Did the capacity planning (Volume + CPU and I/O) of Teradata's Production systems (in R + PowerBI) : <b>Provided the customer enough information to make the educated decision to buy new Teradata nodes</b>
          - Developed KPIs on Teradata hardware and critical data pipelines to give a better vision to upper management of what is really happening in the system they are paying for (prototype in R, industrialisation in Java + Grafana) : <b>Indicators became the go-to reference for management and product teams to see the bottlenecks in the system (and act on it !)</b>
          - Initiated the architecture documentation as a code of the different data products (with PlantUML) : <b>With this documentation at least two product teams stopped maintaining obsolete data pipelines which were still there only because of turnover and lack of useful documentation</b>
          - Among others participations in productions incidents, detected a hardware problem on an array of slow disk after a one week production crisis (Python + SQL) : <b>Disks changed, SLA back !</b>
          - Trained junior developper to SQL best practices in a distributed environnments : <b>Fewer SQL mistakes reaching production</b>
          - Optimized critical data pipelines and data products (SQL, Java) : <b>Reduction of processing time between 10% to 80%</b>

      - role: <b>Datalab Technical Expert</b>

            - Redesigned the SQL engine for aggregation of electricity consumers in France : <b>New engine could aggregate 1 year of data in the same time the former engine took to aggregate 1 week with the same functionalities</b>
            - Used Ansible to automate the deployment of the aggregation SQL Engine (and some other datalabs) : <b>Went from a one day manual error prone deployement to 5 minutes click-button robust installation</b>
            - Helped internal customer to optimize their adhoc SQL queries, R and Python scripts : <b>Sometimes 99% of time savings with the same output result</b>
            - Trained internal customers and datalab developpers to SQL best practices in a distributed environnments and introduction to R and Python for data analysis: <b>More than 10 sessions with an average of 6 trainees each time</b>
            - Developed of a reactive Web App for Enedis strategy department in R Shiny to show the repartition of energy consumption : <b>Done in a week without prior Shiny knowledge with good customer feedback</b>
